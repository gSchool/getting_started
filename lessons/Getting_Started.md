# Getting Started

The Galvanize Software Development Immersive is an intensive 12-week* course that will prepare you with critical skills to be a software developer. 

We are looking for service-members who enjoy problem-solving and want to take their technical skills to the next level. Although no previous
experience is required, our entrance assessment will require some basic development skills.

We strongly recommend you go through the available prep work. The prep work will prepare you with basic development skills needed to pass the assessment and be accepted to the program. Alternatively, if you are already proficient in JavaScript fundamentals you are welcome to take the assessment without doing prep work.

**Note: Course length may range from 12-14 weeks and is dependent on the OPM Federal Holiday schedule. Please check the schedule of upcoming cohorts to confirm class dates.*
