# We've moved! 

We have officially transitioned to the FY24 DoD & Federal Agency Software Development Immersive Application. Please note the following: 

* In order to be considered for enrollment for a FY24 course, you **must** have an active FY24 application.
* The Applicant Survey is REQUIRED. You must fill out the survey in the FY24 application in order for our team to support your application and enrollment journey. 
* **If you have assessed within the last 6 months**, please reach out to our Federal Enrollment team at federal.enrollment@galvnaize.com. We can port your score into the FY24 application.
